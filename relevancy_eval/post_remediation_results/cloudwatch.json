This metric helps SREs monitor the health and usability of the API by identifying when clients are sending invalid or unauthorized requests.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nUse this metric to detect and investigate issues such as malformed requests, missing authentication tokens, or unauthorized access attempts that may indicate problems with client integrations, API usage patterns, or security configurations.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on your API\\u2019s normal traffic patterns and error tolerance. For example, trigger an alert if the 4XXError count exceeds 5% of total requests or if there is a sudden spike (e.g., a 50% increase) compared to the baseline over a 5-minute period. Thresholds should be adjusted to minimize false positives while ensuring timely detection of client-side issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High 4XXError count:** Indicates frequent client errors, which may degrade user experience, increase support tickets, or signal misconfigured clients or API changes that are not backward compatible. Persistent high rates warrant investigation into request validation, authentication flows, or API documentation.  \\n- **Low or zero 4XXError count:** Generally positive, indicating clients are successfully interacting with the API. However, an unexpected drop to zero in a normally active API might suggest monitoring gaps or client-side issues preventing requests.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display the 4XXError metric alongside total request count and 5XXError metrics to provide a comprehensive view of API health. Use a line graph showing 4XXError rate (%) over time to spot trends or anomalies.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when the 4XXError count exceeds 100 errors within 5 minutes or when the error rate surpasses 5% of total requests, notifying the SRE team via SNS for immediate investigation.  \\n\\nThis approach enables proactive detection and resolution of client-side issues, improving API reliability and user satisfaction.\", \" - The **5XXError** metric in the **AWS/ApiGateway** namespace tracks the total count of server-side HTTP 5xx errors returned by your API Gateway within a specified time interval, filtered by API name and stage.

Immediate investigation is required to identify root causes such as integration timeouts, Lambda function errors, or misconfigured endpoints.  \\n- **Low or zero 5XXError values:** Suggest stable backend performance and healthy API operation, though occasional errors should be expected depending on traffic volume.\\n\\n**Example Usage in Dashboard or Alert Rule:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display a time series graph of 5XXError counts alongside latency and request volume for each API stage to correlate error spikes with traffic surges or latency increases.  \\n- **Alert Rule (CloudWatch Alarm):**  \\n  - Metric: `AWS/ApiGateway` \\u2192 `5XXError`  \\n  - Dimensions: `ApiName = \\\"*\\\"`, `Stage = \\\"*\\\"`  \\n  - Statistic: Sum over 1-minute periods  \\n  - Threshold: Greater than 5 errors per minute for 3 consecutive periods  \\n  - Action: Send notification to on-call team via SNS or PagerDuty for immediate investigation.\\n\\nBy actively monitoring the 5XXError metric with appropriate thresholds and contextual dashboards, SREs can quickly detect backend failures, minimize downtime, and maintain API reliability.\", \" - The 5xxErrorRate metric measures the percentage of HTTP requests that resulted in a server-side error (status code 500-599). This includes errors such as internal server errors, service unavailable errors, and gateway timeouts. The metric indicates the proportion of requests that failed due to issues on the server-side, which can be indicative of problems with application logic, configuration, or resource constraints. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include identifying trends in error rates over time, correlating errors with specific user actions or request patterns, and triggering alerts when error rates exceed a certain threshold. This metric is particularly useful for detecting issues that may not be immediately apparent through other metrics, such as request latency or throughput.\", \" - The 5xxErrors metric measures the number of HTTP server error responses (status codes between 500 and 599) returned by Route 53 health checks. This metric indicates that there is a problem with the underlying infrastructure or application, preventing it from serving requests correctly. Potential implications include: \\n\\n- Application downtime or performance degradation.\\n- Infrastructure issues such as network connectivity problems, server crashes, or resource exhaustion.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to these issues promptly. For example, setting up an alert when the 5xxErrors count exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 10 errors within a 1-minute window) can trigger notifications to on-call engineers or DevOps teams to investigate and resolve the issue before it affects end-users.\", \" - The HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count metric measures the number of HTTP requests that resulted in a 5XX status code (server errors) from targets within a specific target group and Availability Zone.

Thresholds should be adjusted based on function criticality and invocation volume.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High Errors:** Indicates function instability, leading to failed requests, degraded user experience, or downstream system failures. Persistent high error counts require immediate investigation and remediation.  \\n- **Low or Zero Errors:** Suggests stable function execution and healthy code/runtime environment.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display a time series graph of Errors alongside Invocations and Duration to correlate error spikes with latency or traffic changes.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Trigger an alert if Errors > 1 for 3 consecutive 1-minute periods or if the error rate exceeds 5% over 5 minutes, notifying the on-call team to investigate.\\n\\nBy monitoring the **AWS/Lambda Errors** metric with appropriate thresholds and context, SREs can proactively maintain Lambda function health and minimize service disruptions.\", \" - The 4xxErrorRate metric measures the percentage of HTTP requests that resulted in a client-side error (HTTP status codes between 400 and 499).

This metric indicates the peak utilization of write capacity during a given time period, which can be used to identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation. High values may indicate that the provisioned write capacity is insufficient to handle the workload, leading to increased latency or errors. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect when the write capacity needs to be scaled up or if there are issues with data consistency.\", \" - The **BytesDownloaded** metric in the **AWS/CloudFront** namespace tracks the total number of bytes transferred from CloudFront edge locations to viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests across all distributions (indicated by `\\\"DistributionId\\\": \\\"*\\\"`). This metric reflects the volume of outbound data delivered to end users globally and is essential for understanding traffic load, bandwidth usage, and content delivery efficiency.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor data transfer trends, detect unusual spikes or drops in traffic, and assess the effectiveness of caching and compression strategies. It helps identify potential issues such as unexpectedly high data transfer costs, inefficient content delivery, or client-side performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n**Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on historical baseline usage and business expectations. For example, trigger a warning if BytesDownloaded exceeds 120% of the average daily volume over the past week, indicating a potential traffic surge or misconfiguration. Conversely, alert if the metric drops below 50% of the baseline, which may signal distribution outages or client access issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High BytesDownloaded:** May indicate increased user demand, successful content campaigns, or inefficient caching leading to higher bandwidth costs. Persistent spikes warrant investigation into traffic sources and content optimization.  \\n- **Low BytesDownloaded:** Could suggest reduced user engagement, distribution misconfiguration, or caching serving stale content. Sudden drops require checking distribution health and origin availability.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot BytesDownloaded alongside CacheHitRate and 4xx/5xx error metrics to correlate data transfer with cache efficiency and error rates. An alert rule might be:  \\n- **Condition:** BytesDownloaded > 1 TB in 1 hour (adjust based on typical traffic)  \\n- **Action:** Notify SRE team to investigate potential traffic anomalies or cost impacts.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive monitoring of CloudFront data delivery, helping maintain performance, control costs, and ensure a smooth end-user experience.\", \" - The BytesUploaded metric measures the total number of bytes uploaded to Amazon CloudFront by viewers for POST, PUT, and other requests that upload data.

This includes both GET and non-GET requests, such as POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The metric provides a count of requests over a specified time period, allowing for monitoring of traffic patterns, load, and potential bottlenecks in the distribution's performance. Potential implications or usage in monitoring or alerting include: triggering alerts when request rates exceed expected thresholds, identifying peak hours or days to optimize resource allocation, and correlating request metrics with other CloudFront metrics (e.g., latency, errors) for a more comprehensive understanding of service performance.\", \" - The **BytesDownloaded** metric in the **AWS/CloudFront** namespace tracks the total number of bytes transferred from CloudFront edge locations to viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests across all distributions (indicated by `\\\"DistributionId\\\": \\\"*\\\"`). This metric reflects the volume of outbound data delivered to end users globally and is essential for understanding traffic load, bandwidth usage, and content delivery efficiency.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor data transfer trends, detect unusual spikes or drops in traffic, and assess the effectiveness of caching and compression strategies. It helps identify potential issues such as unexpectedly high data transfer costs, inefficient content delivery, or client-side performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n**Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on historical baseline usage and business expectations. For example, trigger a warning if BytesDownloaded exceeds 120% of the average daily volume over the past week, indicating a potential traffic surge or misconfiguration. Conversely, alert if the metric drops below 50% of the baseline, which may signal distribution outages or client access issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High BytesDownloaded:** May indicate increased user demand, successful content campaigns, or inefficient caching leading to higher bandwidth costs. Persistent spikes warrant investigation into traffic sources and content optimization.  \\n- **Low BytesDownloaded:** Could suggest reduced user engagement, distribution misconfiguration, or caching serving stale content. Sudden drops require checking distribution health and origin availability.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot BytesDownloaded alongside CacheHitRate and 4xx/5xx error metrics to correlate data transfer with cache efficiency and error rates. An alert rule might be:  \\n- **Condition:** BytesDownloaded > 1 TB in 1 hour (adjust based on typical traffic)  \\n- **Action:** Notify SRE team to investigate potential traffic anomalies or cost impacts.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive monitoring of CloudFront data delivery, helping maintain performance, control costs, and ensure a smooth end-user experience.\", \" - The **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** metric in the **AWS/ApplicationELB** namespace tracks the total number of successful HTTP responses (status codes 200-299) returned by targets in a specified target group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). It reflects how many requests your application is successfully handling over a given period, aggregated across all Availability Zones.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nThis metric helps SREs monitor the effective throughput of healthy requests served by the target group. It is a direct indicator of application availability and user experience, showing that requests are being processed without errors.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerting Guidance:**  \\n- **Low values or sudden drops:** May indicate application downtime, target group health issues, or routing problems causing fewer successful responses. For example, if the 2XX count falls below 80% of the baseline average for 5 consecutive minutes, it should trigger an alert.  \\n- **High values:** Typically indicate increased traffic volume. While not inherently problematic, a sudden unexpected spike could signal abnormal load or potential abuse, warranting investigation.\\n\\n**Impact:**  \\n- **Low HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Users may experience errors, timeouts, or degraded service quality. This often correlates with increased 4XX/5XX errors or latency.  \\n- **High HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Generally positive, indicating healthy request handling, but should be correlated with resource utilization metrics to ensure capacity is sufficient.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display this metric alongside **HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count**, **HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count**, and **TargetResponseTime** to get a holistic view of application health and performance.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers if **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** drops below a threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute) for 5 minutes, indicating potential service disruption. Combine this with alarms on error rates and latency for comprehensive monitoring.\\n\\nBy monitoring **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** with these guidelines, SREs can proactively detect and respond to application availability issues and maintain reliable service delivery.\", \" - The ActiveConnectionCount metric measures the total number of concurrent TCP connections that are active from clients to the load balancer in a specific Availability Zone (AZ). This metric indicates the current workload and capacity utilization of the load balancer within the specified AZ. It can be used to monitor the load balancer's performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize its configuration for better resource allocation. Potential implications include: \\n\\n- High connection counts may indicate a need for increased instance capacity or load balancing across multiple AZs.\\n- Low connection counts might suggest underutilization of resources or inefficient routing.\\n- Sudden spikes in connections could signal a DDoS attack or other security incidents.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in conjunction with other metrics, such as CPU utilization and memory usage, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the load balancer's overall health and performance.\", \" - The FirstByteLatency metric measures the time elapsed between when CloudFront receives a request and sends the first byte of the response to the viewer. This metric is crucial for understanding the performance of CloudFront distributions and identifying potential bottlenecks in the delivery process. High values may indicate issues with origin latency, caching, or network connectivity, which can impact user experience and application availability. Potential usage includes monitoring average FirstByteLatency across all requests, setting alerts for high latency thresholds (e.g., > 100ms), and correlating this metric with other metrics like RequestCount or ErrorRate to diagnose root causes of performance issues.\"]}": {

This value represents the maximum number of strongly consistent reads that can be performed on the table per second, taking into account both the read throughput and the consistency level. A higher provisioned read capacity unit indicates a greater ability to handle increased read traffic without impacting performance. In monitoring or alerting, this metric can be used to detect potential issues such as under-provisioning of read capacity units, which may lead to slow query times or timeouts. It's essential to regularly review and adjust the provisioned read capacity units based on actual usage patterns to ensure optimal table performance.\", \" - The 'ReadThrottleEvents' metric in the namespace 'AWS/DynamoDB' measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned read capacity units for a table or a global secondary index. This metric indicates potential performance bottlenecks and resource constraints, which can lead to increased latency, errors, or even service unavailability. It is essential to monitor this metric to ensure that the provisioned read capacity units are sufficient to handle the workload, and to adjust them accordingly to maintain optimal performance. Potential implications for operations include: (1) Identifying under-provisioned resources and scaling up capacity to prevent throttling events; (2) Detecting sudden spikes in traffic or changes in application behavior that require additional capacity; (3) Correlating with other metrics, such as latency or error rates, to understand the impact of read throttle events on overall system performance. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to trigger notifications when a certain threshold is exceeded, allowing operations teams to proactively address potential issues before they affect end-users.\", \" - The MaxProvisionedTableReadCapacityUtilization metric measures the maximum ratio of consumed to provisioned read capacity units for a table or a global secondary index in Amazon DynamoDB. This metric indicates the peak utilization of read capacity units (RCUs) during a specified time period, which can help identify potential performance bottlenecks and inform scaling decisions. High values may indicate that the current provisioned RCU is insufficient to handle the workload, leading to increased latency or errors. Conversely, low values suggest underutilization of RCUs, potentially indicating over-provisioning. This metric is useful for monitoring and alerting purposes, enabling operations teams to proactively manage DynamoDB resources and ensure optimal performance.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The WriteThrottleEvents metric measures the number of write requests that were throttled due to exceeding the provisioned write capacity in Amazon DynamoDB. This occurs when the rate of write operations exceeds the configured throughput for a table or secondary index, causing AWS to temporarily suspend writes until the rate decreases. The metric can be used to monitor and alert on potential issues with write performance, such as sudden spikes in traffic or configuration errors. It may also indicate that additional provisioned capacity is required to handle expected workloads. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can trigger notifications when a certain threshold of throttled events is reached within a specified time window, allowing operations teams to investigate and address the issue before it impacts application availability.\"]}": {

This value represents the maximum number of writes (e.g., put, update, delete operations) that can be performed on the table within a given time period, typically one second. The metric is used to track the allocated resources and ensure that the table's performance meets the expected requirements. High values may indicate over-provisioning, while low values might suggest under-provisioning or inefficient usage. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with write capacity utilization, such as sudden spikes or prolonged periods of high usage, which could impact application performance or lead to additional costs due to unused provisioned capacity.\", \" - The 'ReadThrottleEvents' metric in the namespace 'AWS/DynamoDB' measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned read capacity units for a table or a global secondary index. This metric indicates potential performance bottlenecks and resource constraints, which can lead to increased latency, errors, or even service unavailability. It is essential to monitor this metric to ensure that the provisioned read capacity units are sufficient to handle the workload, and to adjust them accordingly to maintain optimal performance. Potential implications for operations include: (1) Identifying under-provisioned resources and scaling up capacity to prevent throttling events; (2) Detecting sudden spikes in traffic or changes in application behavior that require additional capacity; (3) Correlating with other metrics, such as latency or error rates, to understand the impact of read throttle events on overall system performance. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to trigger notifications when a certain threshold is exceeded, allowing operations teams to proactively address potential issues before they affect end-users.\", \" - The **ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions** metric in the **AWS/Lambda** namespace measures the number of Lambda function instances currently running with provisioned concurrency enabled. This metric reflects the active usage of pre-allocated, reserved concurrency capacity that you have configured and paid for, ensuring consistent performance by reducing cold starts.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nFor an SRE, this metric is critical to monitor how much of the provisioned concurrency is actively utilized. It helps in capacity planning, cost management, and maintaining application performance by ensuring that the provisioned concurrency matches actual demand.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerts:**  \\n- **Alert if ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions approaches or equals the provisioned concurrency limit** (e.g., \\u2265 90% of provisioned concurrency). This indicates that the reserved capacity is nearly fully utilized, risking throttling of additional requests or cold starts if demand spikes beyond provisioned capacity.  \\n- **Alert if ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions remains consistently low** (e.g., \\u2264 10% of provisioned concurrency over a sustained period), which may indicate over-provisioning and unnecessary cost.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values near the provisioned concurrency limit:** Signal high utilization and potential risk of throttling if demand increases. This may require increasing provisioned concurrency or enabling autoscaling policies.  \\n- **Low values:** Suggest underutilization of provisioned concurrency, leading to wasted costs without performance benefits.\\n\\n**Example Use Case:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions** alongside the configured provisioned concurrency limit for each Lambda function. Set an alert rule to trigger when **ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions** exceeds 90% of the provisioned concurrency for more than 5 minutes, prompting investigation or scaling actions. Conversely, monitor for sustained low usage to optimize cost by reducing provisioned concurrency.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive management of Lambda concurrency to balance performance reliability and cost efficiency.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The Throttles metric measures the number of AWS Lambda function invocation attempts that were throttled due to invocation rates exceeding the concurrent execution quota. This quota is enforced by AWS to prevent overwhelming the service with too many simultaneous invocations, which can lead to performance degradation and resource exhaustion. The metric provides insight into the frequency at which Lambda functions are being invoked beyond their allowed concurrency limits, indicating potential issues with application design, scaling, or configuration. It may be used in monitoring and alerting to detect situations where Lambda function invocation rates are approaching or exceeding the concurrent execution quota, triggering further investigation and optimization efforts to prevent throttling and ensure reliable service operation.\"]}": {

This cumulative counter increments with every incoming packet, providing a real-time measure of inbound network activity. \\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor the volume and pattern of incoming network traffic to detect anomalies such as sudden spikes that may indicate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, network scanning, or other security threats. It also helps assess network interface utilization to prevent saturation, which can degrade application performance.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on baseline traffic patterns for your application. For example, if your instance typically receives 10,000 packets per minute, an alert could trigger if the rate exceeds 50,000 packets per minute sustained over 5 minutes, signaling unusual traffic spikes. Conversely, a sudden drop to near zero packets might indicate network connectivity issues or instance failure.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values:** May indicate heavy legitimate traffic, a DDoS attack, or misconfigured clients generating excessive requests. Prolonged high packet rates can saturate network interfaces, leading to packet loss and degraded service.  \\n- **Low values:** Could signal network outages, instance misconfiguration, or application downtime, potentially causing service disruption.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **NetworkPacketsIn** alongside CPU utilization and NetworkPacketsOut to correlate network traffic with system load. For alerting, create a CloudWatch alarm with a metric math expression calculating the packets per second over a 5-minute window, triggering if the value exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 800 packets/second) for 3 consecutive periods, enabling proactive response to abnormal network conditions.\", \" - The **NetworkPacketsOut** metric in the **AWS/EC2** namespace measures the total number of network packets sent out from all network interfaces of a specified EC2 instance. It is a cumulative count of packets transmitted, regardless of delivery success, including both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The unit of measurement is packets. This metric helps monitor outbound network traffic volume and detect unusual spikes or connectivity issues.\", \" - The ActiveConnectionCount metric measures the total number of concurrent TCP connections that are active from clients to the load balancer in a specific Availability Zone (AZ). This metric indicates the current workload and capacity utilization of the load balancer within the specified AZ. It can be used to monitor the load balancer's performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize its configuration for better resource allocation. Potential implications include: \\n\\n- High connection counts may indicate a need for increased instance capacity or load balancing across multiple AZs.\\n- Low connection counts might suggest underutilization of resources or inefficient routing.\\n- Sudden spikes in connections could signal a DDoS attack or other security incidents.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in conjunction with other metrics, such as CPU utilization and memory usage, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the load balancer's overall health and performance.\", \" - The NetworkOut metric measures the total number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by an AWS instance. This includes both outgoing traffic from the instance to other hosts and services, as well as any traffic generated by the instance itself, such as DNS requests or system updates. The metric provides a comprehensive view of the instance's outbound network activity, which can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.\\n\\nPotential implications or usage in monitoring or alerting include:\\n- Identifying instances with high network utilization, which may indicate resource bottlenecks or security issues.\\n- Detecting unusual patterns of outgoing traffic that could indicate malware or other security threats.\\n- Monitoring the impact of changes to instance configurations or network policies on outbound traffic.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in conjunction with other metrics, such as NetworkIn, to gain a more complete understanding of an instance's network activity and identify potential issues.\", \" - The NumberOfNotificationsFailed metric measures the total count of notifications that have failed to deliver to their intended recipients.

Requires investigation into workload spikes, possible volume resizing, or optimization.  \\n- **Low VolumeWriteOps:** Could indicate underutilized storage resources, potentially allowing cost optimization by downsizing volumes or consolidating workloads.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display a time series graph of **VolumeWriteOps** alongside **VolumeReadOps** and **VolumeQueueLength** for each critical EBS volume to correlate write activity with latency and queue buildup.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when **VolumeWriteOps** exceeds 90% of the volume\\u2019s provisioned IOPS for 5 consecutive minutes, indicating potential I/O saturation requiring immediate attention.  \\n\\nBy actively monitoring **VolumeWriteOps**, SREs can maintain optimal storage performance, prevent application slowdowns, and optimize cost-efficiency of EBS volumes.\", \" - The VolumeQueueLength metric measures the number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time for an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. This metric indicates the queue length, which is the number of I/O operations that are pending completion. A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance. However, without further context or information about the specific use case or environment, it is unclear how this metric might be used in operations.\", \" - The VolumeThroughputPercentage metric in the AWS/EBS namespace measures the percentage of I/O operations per second (IOPS) delivered by an Amazon EBS volume compared to its total provisioned IOPS. This metric indicates how efficiently the volume is utilizing its allocated IOPS capacity, which can be a critical factor in maintaining optimal performance and preventing bottlenecks. A high VolumeThroughputPercentage value suggests that the volume is effectively handling incoming I/O requests within its allocated limits, whereas a low value may indicate underutilization or potential issues with I/O throughput. This metric can be used to monitor EBS volume performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation for improved application responsiveness and overall system efficiency.\", \" - This metric, VolumeIOPSExceededCheck, measures the number of times an application has attempted to drive I/O operations per second (IOPS) that exceed the provisioned performance of a volume within a one-minute window. The metric can have two possible values: 0 indicates that the provisioned IOPS were not exceeded during this period, while a value of 1 signifies that the provisioned IOPS were consistently exceeded. This information is crucial for identifying potential storage bottlenecks or overprovisioning issues in AWS environments. It can be used to trigger alerts when applications are pushing beyond their allocated IOPS limits, indicating a need for either increased provisioning or optimization of application performance.

This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The WriteThrottleEvents metric measures the number of write requests that were throttled due to exceeding the provisioned write capacity in Amazon DynamoDB. This occurs when the rate of write operations exceeds the configured throughput for a table or secondary index, causing AWS to temporarily suspend writes until the rate decreases. The metric can be used to monitor and alert on potential issues with write performance, such as sudden spikes in traffic or configuration errors. It may also indicate that additional provisioned capacity is required to handle expected workloads. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can trigger notifications when a certain threshold of throttled events is reached within a specified time window, allowing operations teams to investigate and address the issue before it impacts application availability.\"]}": {

It also helps assess network interface utilization to prevent saturation, which can degrade application performance.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on baseline traffic patterns for your application. For example, if your instance typically receives 10,000 packets per minute, an alert could trigger if the rate exceeds 50,000 packets per minute sustained over 5 minutes, signaling unusual traffic spikes. Conversely, a sudden drop to near zero packets might indicate network connectivity issues or instance failure.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values:** May indicate heavy legitimate traffic, a DDoS attack, or misconfigured clients generating excessive requests. Prolonged high packet rates can saturate network interfaces, leading to packet loss and degraded service.  \\n- **Low values:** Could signal network outages, instance misconfiguration, or application downtime, potentially causing service disruption.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **NetworkPacketsIn** alongside CPU utilization and NetworkPacketsOut to correlate network traffic with system load.

This includes incoming traffic from various sources such as other instances, services, or external networks. It is a cumulative measure that increments with each byte received, providing insight into the volume of incoming network activity. In monitoring and alerting, NetworkIn can be used to detect potential issues such as DDoS attacks, network congestion, or misconfigured security groups. It can also help identify instances experiencing high network utilization, which may impact performance or lead to resource exhaustion.

This metric is a percentage value, indicating how close the instance is to reaching its EBS IOPS limit. A higher value indicates that the instance is approaching or has exceeded its allocated IOPS capacity, which can lead to performance degradation and potential throttling by AWS.

A failed I/O check can be an indication of underlying storage issues, such as disk errors, high latency, or insufficient resources. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential storage performance problems, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

This metric is a key indicator of storage performance and can be used to monitor the I/O latency of EBS volumes, which can impact application performance and user experience. High average read latency may indicate issues with disk utilization, network congestion, or underlying infrastructure problems. Potential implications for monitoring or alerting include: setting thresholds for high latency (e.g., > 10ms) to trigger alerts when storage performance is degraded; correlating this metric with other metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage to identify root causes of performance issues; and using it as a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to track the overall health and efficiency of EBS volumes over time.

A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance.

This cumulative counter increments with every incoming packet, providing a real-time measure of inbound network activity. \\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor the volume and pattern of incoming network traffic to detect anomalies such as sudden spikes that may indicate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, network scanning, or other security threats. It also helps assess network interface utilization to prevent saturation, which can degrade application performance.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on baseline traffic patterns for your application. For example, if your instance typically receives 10,000 packets per minute, an alert could trigger if the rate exceeds 50,000 packets per minute sustained over 5 minutes, signaling unusual traffic spikes. Conversely, a sudden drop to near zero packets might indicate network connectivity issues or instance failure.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values:** May indicate heavy legitimate traffic, a DDoS attack, or misconfigured clients generating excessive requests. Prolonged high packet rates can saturate network interfaces, leading to packet loss and degraded service.  \\n- **Low values:** Could signal network outages, instance misconfiguration, or application downtime, potentially causing service disruption.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **NetworkPacketsIn** alongside CPU utilization and NetworkPacketsOut to correlate network traffic with system load. For alerting, create a CloudWatch alarm with a metric math expression calculating the packets per second over a 5-minute window, triggering if the value exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 800 packets/second) for 3 consecutive periods, enabling proactive response to abnormal network conditions.\", \" - The **NetworkPacketsOut** metric in the **AWS/EC2** namespace measures the total number of network packets sent out from all network interfaces of a specified EC2 instance. It is a cumulative count of packets transmitted, regardless of delivery success, including both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The unit of measurement is packets. This metric helps monitor outbound network traffic volume and detect unusual spikes or connectivity issues.\", \" - The ActiveConnectionCount metric measures the total number of concurrent TCP connections that are active from clients to the load balancer in a specific Availability Zone (AZ). This metric indicates the current workload and capacity utilization of the load balancer within the specified AZ. It can be used to monitor the load balancer's performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize its configuration for better resource allocation. Potential implications include: \\n\\n- High connection counts may indicate a need for increased instance capacity or load balancing across multiple AZs.\\n- Low connection counts might suggest underutilization of resources or inefficient routing.\\n- Sudden spikes in connections could signal a DDoS attack or other security incidents.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in conjunction with other metrics, such as CPU utilization and memory usage, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the load balancer's overall health and performance.\", \" - The MitigatedHostCount metric measures the number of targets that are currently being protected by AWS DDoS mitigation services within a specific Availability Zone (AZ). This count includes all hosts that have been identified as potential attack vectors and are receiving protection from AWS's DDoS mitigation capabilities. The metric is incremented for each host that is deemed mitigated, providing a real-time snapshot of the number of targets being protected in the specified AZ. Potential implications for monitoring or alerting include: (1) Identifying high-traffic zones or regions with increased DDoS activity; (2) Triggering alerts when the count exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential security risks; and (3) Correlating this metric with other AWS services, such as CloudWatch logs or VPC flow logs, to gain deeper insights into DDoS attacks and their impact on infrastructure.

This may indicate issues like misconfigured rules, target failures, or upstream event source problems.  \\n- **High invocation count:** Alert on sudden spikes exceeding a threshold (e.g., 2x the average invocation rate) which could signal unexpected traffic surges, potential abuse, or runaway processes.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values:** May reflect increased legitimate traffic or a surge in events, which could lead to resource exhaustion or increased costs if not managed.  \\n- **Low values:** Could indicate that events are not being generated or processed, potentially causing downstream data loss or service degradation.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display a time series graph of Invocations per rule to visualize event flow trends and detect anomalies.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers if Invocations fall below 10 for 5 consecutive minutes, indicating a possible outage or misconfiguration in the event pipeline.\\n\\nBy monitoring the Invocations metric with appropriate thresholds and alerts, SRE teams can proactively detect and respond to issues affecting event-driven architectures built on AWS EventBridge.\", \" - The Invocations metric measures the total number of times a function is invoked in response to an event or invocation API call. This includes both successful and failed invocations, providing a comprehensive view of the function's usage and performance. Potential implications for monitoring include identifying trends in function invocation rates, detecting anomalies that may indicate issues with the function or underlying infrastructure. In alerting, this metric can be used to trigger notifications when invocation rates exceed expected thresholds, indicating potential performance degradation or resource exhaustion. Additionally, this metric can inform capacity planning decisions by providing insights into the actual usage of functions and resources.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The Throttles metric measures the number of AWS Lambda function invocation attempts that were throttled due to invocation rates exceeding the concurrent execution quota. This quota is enforced by AWS to prevent overwhelming the service with too many simultaneous invocations, which can lead to performance degradation and resource exhaustion. The metric provides insight into the frequency at which Lambda functions are being invoked beyond their allowed concurrency limits, indicating potential issues with application design, scaling, or configuration. It may be used in monitoring and alerting to detect situations where Lambda function invocation rates are approaching or exceeding the concurrent execution quota, triggering further investigation and optimization efforts to prevent throttling and ensure reliable service operation.\"]}": {

It helps in capacity planning, cost management, and maintaining application performance by ensuring that the provisioned concurrency matches actual demand.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerts:**  \\n- **Alert if ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions approaches or equals the provisioned concurrency limit** (e.g., \\u2265 90% of provisioned concurrency). This indicates that the reserved capacity is nearly fully utilized, risking throttling of additional requests or cold starts if demand spikes beyond provisioned capacity.  \\n- **Alert if ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions remains consistently low** (e.g., \\u2264 10% of provisioned concurrency over a sustained period), which may indicate over-provisioning and unnecessary cost.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values near the provisioned concurrency limit:** Signal high utilization and potential risk of throttling if demand increases. This may require increasing provisioned concurrency or enabling autoscaling policies.  \\n- **Low values:** Suggest underutilization of provisioned concurrency, leading to wasted costs without performance benefits.\\n\\n**Example Use Case:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions** alongside the configured provisioned concurrency limit for each Lambda function. Set an alert rule to trigger when **ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions** exceeds 90% of the provisioned concurrency for more than 5 minutes, prompting investigation or scaling actions. Conversely, monitor for sustained low usage to optimize cost by reducing provisioned concurrency.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive management of Lambda concurrency to balance performance reliability and cost efficiency.\", \" - The ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations metric measures the number of times a function's code is executed on standard concurrency when all provisioned concurrency is in use. This indicates that the function has exceeded its allocated concurrent execution capacity and is relying on standard concurrency to handle additional invocations. High values for this metric may indicate inefficient resource utilization, potential performance bottlenecks, or even errors in provisioning concurrency limits. It can be used to monitor and alert on situations where functions are consistently spilling over into standard concurrency, allowing teams to adjust their concurrency settings, optimize function code, or scale up resources as needed.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The ThrottledRules metric measures the number of AWS Lambda function rule invocations that were throttled due to invocation rate limits. This occurs when the frequency or volume of incoming events exceeds the configured rate at which the function can process them. The metric provides insight into potential performance bottlenecks and resource constraints within the AWS environment, enabling operations teams to identify areas for optimization and improvement. It may be used in monitoring and alerting scenarios to detect situations where rule invocations are being throttled, indicating a need for increased capacity or adjustments to rate limits.\", \" - The Throttles metric measures the number of AWS Lambda function invocation attempts that were throttled due to invocation rates exceeding the concurrent execution quota. This quota is enforced by AWS to prevent overwhelming the service with too many simultaneous invocations, which can lead to performance degradation and resource exhaustion. The metric provides insight into the frequency at which Lambda functions are being invoked beyond their allowed concurrency limits, indicating potential issues with application design, scaling, or configuration. It may be used in monitoring and alerting to detect situations where Lambda function invocation rates are approaching or exceeding the concurrent execution quota, triggering further investigation and optimization efforts to prevent throttling and ensure reliable service operation.\"]}": {

Therefore, teams may need to supplement this metric with more granular metrics or manual investigation to gain a deeper understanding of their resource usage patterns.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditBalance metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that have been spent by an unlimited Amazon EC2 instance when its CPUCreditBalance is zero. This metric indicates the amount of excess CPU credits used by the instance beyond what was available in its CPUCreditBalance. The surplus credits are typically accumulated during periods of low CPU utilization and can be used to handle short-term spikes in demand without incurring additional costs. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances that are consistently using more CPU credits than expected, potentially indicating inefficient resource allocation or unexpected workload patterns. It may also be useful for capacity planning and rightsizing EC2 instance types to optimize cost-effectiveness.\", \" - The UnhealthyRoutingRequestCount metric measures the number of incoming requests that were routed to targets within an AWS service (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases) that are currently failing health checks. This metric indicates the volume of traffic being sent to unhealthy resources, which can have significant implications for application performance and user experience. High values may indicate issues with target resource availability, scaling, or configuration problems. Potential uses for this metric include identifying bottlenecks in request routing, detecting resource exhaustion, and triggering alerts for proactive maintenance or remediation efforts.\", \" - The UnreservedConcurrentExecutions metric measures the number of concurrent executions available for all functions in a specific AWS region.

Potential implications include triggering alerts when the failure rate exceeds a certain threshold, investigating root causes of frequent failures, or optimizing notification routing strategies to minimize delivery issues.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The WriteThrottleEvents metric measures the number of write requests that were throttled due to exceeding the provisioned write capacity in Amazon DynamoDB. This occurs when the rate of write operations exceeds the configured throughput for a table or secondary index, causing AWS to temporarily suspend writes until the rate decreases. The metric can be used to monitor and alert on potential issues with write performance, such as sudden spikes in traffic or configuration errors. It may also indicate that additional provisioned capacity is required to handle expected workloads. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can trigger notifications when a certain threshold of throttled events is reached within a specified time window, allowing operations teams to investigate and address the issue before it impacts application availability.\"]}": {

This metric indicates the amount of excess CPU credits used by the instance beyond what was available in its CPUCreditBalance. The surplus credits are typically accumulated during periods of low CPU utilization and can be used to handle short-term spikes in demand without incurring additional costs. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances that are consistently using more CPU credits than expected, potentially indicating inefficient resource allocation or unexpected workload patterns. It may also be useful for capacity planning and rightsizing EC2 instance types to optimize cost-effectiveness.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditsCharged metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that are charged to an AWS instance when they exceed the maximum number of earned credits allowed. This occurs when an instance consumes more CPU resources than its allocated capacity, resulting in a deficit of earned credits.

The metric indicates how many credits have been consumed due to CPU activity, which can be used to estimate the remaining capacity or potential overage costs. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can be used to detect instances that are approaching their credit limits, allowing for proactive resource optimization and cost management.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditBalance metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that have been spent by an unlimited Amazon EC2 instance when its CPUCreditBalance is zero. This metric indicates the amount of excess CPU credits used by the instance beyond what was available in its CPUCreditBalance. The surplus credits are typically accumulated during periods of low CPU utilization and can be used to handle short-term spikes in demand without incurring additional costs. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances that are consistently using more CPU credits than expected, potentially indicating inefficient resource allocation or unexpected workload patterns. It may also be useful for capacity planning and rightsizing EC2 instance types to optimize cost-effectiveness.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditsCharged metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that are charged to an AWS instance when they exceed the maximum number of earned credits allowed. This occurs when an instance consumes more CPU resources than its allocated capacity, resulting in a deficit of earned credits. The charged surplus credits are then deducted from the instance's account. This metric can be used to monitor and alert on instances that consistently or intermittently consume excessive CPU resources, leading to unnecessary charges. It may also indicate potential issues with instance sizing, workload optimization, or resource utilization. Monitoring this metric can help prevent unexpected costs and ensure optimal resource allocation.\", \" - The CPUUtilization metric measures the percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This value is calculated as a rolling average over a one-minute period and represents the average utilization of the instance's CPU resources during that time. High CPU utilization can indicate resource contention, leading to potential performance issues or even service unavailability. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances with high CPU usage, allowing for proactive capacity planning, load balancing, or even scaling up to prevent overutilization. Additionally, it can be used as a threshold-based alerting mechanism to notify operations teams when CPU utilization exceeds a certain percentage, indicating potential performance degradation.\"]}": {

It is a direct indicator of application availability and user experience, showing that requests are being processed without errors.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerting Guidance:**  \\n- **Low values or sudden drops:** May indicate application downtime, target group health issues, or routing problems causing fewer successful responses. For example, if the 2XX count falls below 80% of the baseline average for 5 consecutive minutes, it should trigger an alert.  \\n- **High values:** Typically indicate increased traffic volume. While not inherently problematic, a sudden unexpected spike could signal abnormal load or potential abuse, warranting investigation.\\n\\n**Impact:**  \\n- **Low HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Users may experience errors, timeouts, or degraded service quality. This often correlates with increased 4XX/5XX errors or latency.  \\n- **High HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Generally positive, indicating healthy request handling, but should be correlated with resource utilization metrics to ensure capacity is sufficient.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display this metric alongside **HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count**, **HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count**, and **TargetResponseTime** to get a holistic view of application health and performance.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers if **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** drops below a threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute) for 5 minutes, indicating potential service disruption. Combine this with alarms on error rates and latency for comprehensive monitoring.\\n\\nBy monitoring **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** with these guidelines, SREs can proactively detect and respond to application availability issues and maintain reliable service delivery.\", \" - The NumberOfMessagesPublished metric measures the total number of messages successfully published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic within a specified time period. This metric counts both individual and batched messages sent to your topic, providing insight into the volume of notifications being processed. In monitoring or alerting scenarios, this metric can be used to detect anomalies in message publishing rates, identify potential issues with SNS topic configuration, or troubleshoot problems with message delivery. For example, if NumberOfMessagesPublished is consistently lower than expected, it may indicate a problem with message encoding, authentication, or network connectivity. Conversely, an unusually high number of messages published could signal a misconfigured SNS topic or a malicious activity attempting to overwhelm the system.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The UnhealthyRoutingRequestCount metric measures the number of incoming requests that were routed to targets within an AWS service (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases) that are currently failing health checks. This metric indicates the volume of traffic being sent to unhealthy resources, which can have significant implications for application performance and user experience. High values may indicate issues with target resource availability, scaling, or configuration problems. Potential uses for this metric include identifying bottlenecks in request routing, detecting resource exhaustion, and triggering alerts for proactive maintenance or remediation efforts.\", \" - The WriteThrottleEvents metric measures the number of write requests that were throttled due to exceeding the provisioned write capacity in Amazon DynamoDB. This occurs when the rate of write operations exceeds the configured throughput for a table or secondary index, causing AWS to temporarily suspend writes until the rate decreases.

This metric reflects the volume of outbound data delivered to end users globally and is essential for understanding traffic load, bandwidth usage, and content delivery efficiency.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor data transfer trends, detect unusual spikes or drops in traffic, and assess the effectiveness of caching and compression strategies. It helps identify potential issues such as unexpectedly high data transfer costs, inefficient content delivery, or client-side performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n**Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on historical baseline usage and business expectations. For example, trigger a warning if BytesDownloaded exceeds 120% of the average daily volume over the past week, indicating a potential traffic surge or misconfiguration. Conversely, alert if the metric drops below 50% of the baseline, which may signal distribution outages or client access issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High BytesDownloaded:** May indicate increased user demand, successful content campaigns, or inefficient caching leading to higher bandwidth costs. Persistent spikes warrant investigation into traffic sources and content optimization.  \\n- **Low BytesDownloaded:** Could suggest reduced user engagement, distribution misconfiguration, or caching serving stale content. Sudden drops require checking distribution health and origin availability.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot BytesDownloaded alongside CacheHitRate and 4xx/5xx error metrics to correlate data transfer with cache efficiency and error rates. An alert rule might be:  \\n- **Condition:** BytesDownloaded > 1 TB in 1 hour (adjust based on typical traffic)  \\n- **Action:** Notify SRE team to investigate potential traffic anomalies or cost impacts.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive monitoring of CloudFront data delivery, helping maintain performance, control costs, and ensure a smooth end-user experience.\", \" - The **PutRequests** metric in the **AWS/S3** namespace tracks the total number of HTTP PUT requests made to an S3 bucket, representing the volume of objects being uploaded or overwritten.

Therefore, it may be useful to complement this metric with additional metrics that provide more granular insights into S3 request behavior.\", \" - The BytesUploaded metric measures the total number of bytes uploaded to Amazon CloudFront by viewers for POST, PUT, and other requests that upload data. This includes all types of file uploads, such as images, videos, and documents, initiated by users accessing content distributed through CloudFront. The metric provides insight into the volume of user-generated content being uploaded to CloudFront, which can be useful in monitoring and optimizing the performance of applications relying on this service. Potential implications for operations include identifying potential bottlenecks or capacity issues related to large file uploads, as well as detecting anomalies in upload patterns that may indicate security threats or other issues.\", \" - The TotalRequestLatency metric measures the total time taken to process requests to an S3 bucket, encompassing both successful and failed requests. This metric is a cumulative value that aggregates latency across all incoming requests, providing insight into the overall performance of your S3 bucket's request processing capabilities. It can be used to identify potential bottlenecks or issues with your application's interaction with the S3 service, such as slow API calls, high queue times, or excessive retries due to failed requests. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can trigger alerts when its value exceeds a certain threshold, indicating that request processing is taking longer than expected, potentially impacting user experience or application performance.\"]}": {

This metric is particularly relevant to AWS services, as it indicates potential issues with request routing or load balancing. The count of non-compliant requests can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, misconfigured settings, or even security vulnerabilities. In monitoring and alerting, this metric can trigger notifications when the count exceeds a certain threshold, prompting operations teams to investigate and adjust the desynchronization mitigation mode accordingly.\", \" - The 'ReadThrottleEvents' metric in the namespace 'AWS/DynamoDB' measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned read capacity units for a table or a global secondary index. This metric indicates potential performance bottlenecks and resource constraints, which can lead to increased latency, errors, or even service unavailability. It is essential to monitor this metric to ensure that the provisioned read capacity units are sufficient to handle the workload, and to adjust them accordingly to maintain optimal performance. Potential implications for operations include: (1) Identifying under-provisioned resources and scaling up capacity to prevent throttling events; (2) Detecting sudden spikes in traffic or changes in application behavior that require additional capacity; (3) Correlating with other metrics, such as latency or error rates, to understand the impact of read throttle events on overall system performance.

These I/O credits enable the volume to burst above its baseline performance level temporarily. Monitoring this metric helps SREs ensure that volumes maintain optimal I/O throughput without being throttled.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nBurstBalance indicates how much burst capacity is left. A value of 100% means the volume has a full burst bucket, while 0% means the burst credits are fully depleted, causing the volume to operate at baseline performance, which may degrade application responsiveness.\\n\\n**Threshold for Alerting:**  \\nSet an alert when BurstBalance falls below 20% for a sustained period (e.g., 5 minutes). This threshold signals that the volume is at risk of throttling, potentially impacting application performance.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values (close to 100%)**: The volume can handle sudden spikes in I/O without performance degradation.  \\n- **Low values (below 20%)**: The volume is running out of burst credits, leading to throttled I/O and slower response times. Prolonged low values may require scaling the volume type or size.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, display BurstBalance as a time series graph per volume to visualize credit consumption trends. For alerting, create a CloudWatch alarm with the condition:  \\n`BurstBalance < 20% for 5 consecutive minutes`  \\nTriggering this alarm should notify the SRE team to investigate and consider upgrading the volume or redistributing workload to prevent performance issues.\", \" - The HTTPCode_Target_3XX_Count metric in the AWS/ApplicationELB namespace measures the number of HTTP responses with a status code between 300 and 399 (inclusive) received by the target group within an Application Load Balancer.

It is a direct indicator of application availability and user experience, showing that requests are being processed without errors.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerting Guidance:**  \\n- **Low values or sudden drops:** May indicate application downtime, target group health issues, or routing problems causing fewer successful responses. For example, if the 2XX count falls below 80% of the baseline average for 5 consecutive minutes, it should trigger an alert.  \\n- **High values:** Typically indicate increased traffic volume. While not inherently problematic, a sudden unexpected spike could signal abnormal load or potential abuse, warranting investigation.\\n\\n**Impact:**  \\n- **Low HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Users may experience errors, timeouts, or degraded service quality. This often correlates with increased 4XX/5XX errors or latency.  \\n- **High HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Generally positive, indicating healthy request handling, but should be correlated with resource utilization metrics to ensure capacity is sufficient.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display this metric alongside **HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count**, **HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count**, and **TargetResponseTime** to get a holistic view of application health and performance.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers if **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** drops below a threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute) for 5 minutes, indicating potential service disruption. Combine this with alarms on error rates and latency for comprehensive monitoring.\\n\\nBy monitoring **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** with these guidelines, SREs can proactively detect and respond to application availability issues and maintain reliable service delivery.\", \" - The **NetworkPacketsIn** metric in the **AWS/EC2** namespace tracks the total number of network packets received by an EC2 instance across all its network interfaces, including both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This cumulative counter increments with every incoming packet, providing a real-time measure of inbound network activity. \\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor the volume and pattern of incoming network traffic to detect anomalies such as sudden spikes that may indicate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, network scanning, or other security threats. It also helps assess network interface utilization to prevent saturation, which can degrade application performance.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on baseline traffic patterns for your application. For example, if your instance typically receives 10,000 packets per minute, an alert could trigger if the rate exceeds 50,000 packets per minute sustained over 5 minutes, signaling unusual traffic spikes. Conversely, a sudden drop to near zero packets might indicate network connectivity issues or instance failure.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High values:** May indicate heavy legitimate traffic, a DDoS attack, or misconfigured clients generating excessive requests. Prolonged high packet rates can saturate network interfaces, leading to packet loss and degraded service.  \\n- **Low values:** Could signal network outages, instance misconfiguration, or application downtime, potentially causing service disruption.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot **NetworkPacketsIn** alongside CPU utilization and NetworkPacketsOut to correlate network traffic with system load. For alerting, create a CloudWatch alarm with a metric math expression calculating the packets per second over a 5-minute window, triggering if the value exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 800 packets/second) for 3 consecutive periods, enabling proactive response to abnormal network conditions.\", \" - The ActiveConnectionCount metric measures the total number of concurrent TCP connections that are active from clients to the load balancer in a specific Availability Zone (AZ).

It is a direct indicator of application availability and user experience, showing that requests are being processed without errors.\\n\\n**Thresholds and Alerting Guidance:**  \\n- **Low values or sudden drops:** May indicate application downtime, target group health issues, or routing problems causing fewer successful responses. For example, if the 2XX count falls below 80% of the baseline average for 5 consecutive minutes, it should trigger an alert.  \\n- **High values:** Typically indicate increased traffic volume. While not inherently problematic, a sudden unexpected spike could signal abnormal load or potential abuse, warranting investigation.\\n\\n**Impact:**  \\n- **Low HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Users may experience errors, timeouts, or degraded service quality. This often correlates with increased 4XX/5XX errors or latency.  \\n- **High HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count:** Generally positive, indicating healthy request handling, but should be correlated with resource utilization metrics to ensure capacity is sufficient.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display this metric alongside **HTTPCode_Target_4XX_Count**, **HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count**, and **TargetResponseTime** to get a holistic view of application health and performance.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers if **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** drops below a threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute) for 5 minutes, indicating potential service disruption. Combine this with alarms on error rates and latency for comprehensive monitoring.\\n\\nBy monitoring **HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count** with these guidelines, SREs can proactively detect and respond to application availability issues and maintain reliable service delivery.\", \" - The DeadLetterErrors metric measures the number of times Amazon Lambda attempts to send an event to a dead-letter queue but encounters an error. This can occur due to various reasons such as issues with the target queue, permissions problems, or transient network errors. A high value for this metric may indicate underlying infrastructure or configuration issues that need attention.

This metric can be used to monitor and alert on instances that consistently or intermittently consume excessive CPU resources, leading to unnecessary charges. It may also indicate potential issues with instance sizing, workload optimization, or resource utilization. Monitoring this metric can help prevent unexpected costs and ensure optimal resource allocation.\", \" - The Invocations metric measures the total number of times a function is invoked in response to an event or invocation API call. This includes both successful and failed invocations, providing a comprehensive view of the function's usage and performance. Potential implications for monitoring include identifying trends in function invocation rates, detecting anomalies that may indicate issues with the function or underlying infrastructure. In alerting, this metric can be used to trigger notifications when invocation rates exceed expected thresholds, indicating potential performance degradation or resource exhaustion. Additionally, this metric can inform capacity planning decisions by providing insights into the actual usage of functions and resources.\", \" - The ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations metric measures the number of times a function's code is executed on standard concurrency when all provisioned concurrency is in use. This indicates that the function has exceeded its allocated concurrent execution capacity and is relying on standard concurrency to handle additional invocations. High values for this metric may indicate inefficient resource utilization, potential performance bottlenecks, or even errors in provisioning concurrency limits. It can be used to monitor and alert on situations where functions are consistently spilling over into standard concurrency, allowing teams to adjust their concurrency settings, optimize function code, or scale up resources as needed.\", \" - This metric measures the percentage of provisioned read capacity units utilized by all tables and global secondary indexes in your AWS account. It indicates how efficiently your DynamoDB resources are being used, helping you identify potential bottlenecks or over-provisioning. High utilization rates may indicate a need to increase read capacity units to maintain performance, while low utilization could suggest underutilization of resources. This metric can be used to monitor and alert on resource utilization, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness in your DynamoDB environment.\"]}": {

This metric reflects the volume of outbound data delivered to end users globally and is essential for understanding traffic load, bandwidth usage, and content delivery efficiency.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nSREs use this metric to monitor data transfer trends, detect unusual spikes or drops in traffic, and assess the effectiveness of caching and compression strategies. It helps identify potential issues such as unexpectedly high data transfer costs, inefficient content delivery, or client-side performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n**Threshold Guidance:**  \\nSet alert thresholds based on historical baseline usage and business expectations. For example, trigger a warning if BytesDownloaded exceeds 120% of the average daily volume over the past week, indicating a potential traffic surge or misconfiguration. Conversely, alert if the metric drops below 50% of the baseline, which may signal distribution outages or client access issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High BytesDownloaded:** May indicate increased user demand, successful content campaigns, or inefficient caching leading to higher bandwidth costs. Persistent spikes warrant investigation into traffic sources and content optimization.  \\n- **Low BytesDownloaded:** Could suggest reduced user engagement, distribution misconfiguration, or caching serving stale content. Sudden drops require checking distribution health and origin availability.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, plot BytesDownloaded alongside CacheHitRate and 4xx/5xx error metrics to correlate data transfer with cache efficiency and error rates. An alert rule might be:  \\n- **Condition:** BytesDownloaded > 1 TB in 1 hour (adjust based on typical traffic)  \\n- **Action:** Notify SRE team to investigate potential traffic anomalies or cost impacts.\\n\\nThis metric enables proactive monitoring of CloudFront data delivery, helping maintain performance, control costs, and ensure a smooth end-user experience.\", \" - The FirstByteLatency metric measures the time elapsed between when CloudFront receives a request and sends the first byte of the response to the viewer. This metric is crucial for understanding the performance of CloudFront distributions and identifying potential bottlenecks in the delivery process. High values may indicate issues with origin latency, caching, or network connectivity, which can impact user experience and application availability. Potential usage includes monitoring average FirstByteLatency across all requests, setting alerts for high latency thresholds (e.g., > 100ms), and correlating this metric with other metrics like RequestCount or ErrorRate to diagnose root causes of performance issues.\", \" - The IntegrationLatency metric measures the time elapsed between when API Gateway forwards a request to the backend and when it receives a response from the backend for a specific stage. This metric is crucial in understanding the performance of API integrations with AWS services or custom applications. High latency values may indicate issues such as slow backend responses, network congestion, or misconfigured integration settings. Potential implications include: (1) Identifying bottlenecks in API workflows and optimizing backend response times to improve overall system responsiveness. (2) Triggering alerts when latency exceeds a certain threshold, enabling prompt investigation into potential service disruptions. (3) Correlating IntegrationLatency with other metrics, such as request count or error rates, to gain a comprehensive view of API performance.\", \" - The ReturnedBytes metric measures the total number of bytes returned by GetRecords operations in Amazon DynamoDB Streams during a specified time period. This metric is useful for monitoring and optimizing data retrieval from DynamoDB Streams. High values may indicate inefficient data processing or excessive data transfer, while low values could suggest underutilization of stream resources. Potential implications include: (1) Identifying bottlenecks in data processing pipelines, (2) Optimizing data transfer rates to reduce latency, (3) Ensuring adequate stream capacity for expected workloads.

For instance, if the NumberOfObjects value consistently exceeds a certain threshold, it may indicate that the bucket is approaching its storage limits, prompting further investigation into data retention policies or infrastructure upgrades.\", \" - The PendingReplicationCount metric measures the number of objects that are pending replication to a destination bucket in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This count includes objects that have been uploaded or modified and are waiting to be replicated to the target storage location. The metric provides insight into the replication pipeline's efficiency and can help identify potential bottlenecks or issues with data consistency.\\n\\nIn monitoring and alerting, this metric can be used to:\\n- Detect replication delays or failures, which may impact data availability or integrity.\\n- Identify trends in replication latency or throughput, allowing for proactive capacity planning or optimization of the replication process.\\n- Trigger alerts when the pending replication count exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential issues with storage capacity or network connectivity.\", \" - The ThrottledRequests metric measures the number of requests to DynamoDB that exceed the provisioned throughput limits on a resource (such as a table or an index). This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The VolumeQueueLength metric measures the number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time for an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. This metric indicates the queue length, which is the number of I/O operations that are pending completion. A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance.
