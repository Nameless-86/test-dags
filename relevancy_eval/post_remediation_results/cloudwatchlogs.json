Alerts should be triggered when latency exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., 500ms for critical APIs or 2x the baseline average) indicating potential performance degradation or SLA violations. High latency values can lead to poor user experience and indicate underlying issues such as resource bottlenecks or network delays, while consistently low latency reflects healthy system responsiveness. For example, a CloudWatch dashboard widget can graph **{\\\"message\\\": \\\"LATENCY*\\\"}** metrics with a red alert line at 500ms, and an alert rule can notify the SRE team if the 95th percentile latency exceeds this threshold for more than 5 minutes.\", \" - This pattern matches log entries from API Gateway execution logs where the response status code indicates a server error (5XX).

High volumes of END events with errors signal potential application issues impacting reliability, while low volumes may indicate reduced traffic or invocation failures upstream. Example alert rule: trigger when the error rate in END logs exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window.

Alerts should trigger when timeout occurrences exceed a defined threshold, such as more than 5 timeouts within 5 minutes, signaling potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints. High timeout rates can lead to failed requests, degraded user experience, and SLA violations, while low or zero timeouts indicate healthy function execution within expected limits. For example, an alert rule can be set to trigger if the count of \\\"TIMEOUT*\\\" messages in **/aws/lambda/** exceeds 5 in a 5-minute window, and a dashboard widget can display a time series graph of timeout counts to monitor trends and quickly identify spikes requiring investigation.\", \" - Monitors AWS Lambda functions for out-of-memory (OOM) errors by detecting log entries in **/aws/lambda/** log groups containing messages starting with \\\"OUT_OF_MEMORY\\\". An alert is triggered when any OOM event occurs, indicating the function exceeded its configured memory limit during execution. High frequency of OOM errors signals insufficient memory allocation, causing function failures and degraded application stability; low or zero occurrences indicate adequate memory provisioning. Example alert rule: trigger an alert if **OUT_OF_MEMORY** messages appear more than 0 times within 5 minutes.

Immediate remediation is needed to maintain application health.  \\n- **Low or zero values:** Indicate stable Lambda executions with no critical errors detected, reflecting healthy application performance.  \\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, display a widget showing the count of ERROR logs from `/aws/lambda/*` over time to quickly spot error spikes.

This log filter identifies ERROR-level messages indicating problems during deployment processes. An alert should be triggered when the count of ERROR messages exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5 errors within 5 minutes), signaling potential deployment instability or failures requiring immediate investigation. High error counts often indicate failed deployments or rollback loops impacting application availability, while low or zero errors suggest stable deployment operations.

High timeout rates can lead to failed requests, degraded user experience, and SLA violations, while low or zero timeouts indicate healthy function execution within expected limits.

High latency values can lead to poor user experience and indicate underlying issues such as resource bottlenecks or network delays, while consistently low latency reflects healthy system responsiveness. For example, a CloudWatch dashboard widget can graph **{\\\"message\\\": \\\"LATENCY*\\\"}** metrics with a red alert line at 500ms, and an alert rule can notify the SRE team if the 95th percentile latency exceeds this threshold for more than 5 minutes.\", \" - Monitors AWS Lambda functions for out-of-memory (OOM) errors by detecting log entries in **/aws/lambda/** log groups containing messages starting with \\\"OUT_OF_MEMORY\\\".

High error counts often indicate failed deployments or rollback loops impacting application availability, while low or zero errors suggest stable deployment operations. For example, use this filter in a CloudWatch alarm or dashboard widget to monitor error frequency, triggering notifications to the SRE team when error rates spike, enabling rapid response to deployment issues.\", \" - Service Discovery logs capture detailed events related to service registration, health checks, and service mesh operations within your microservices architecture. These logs help SREs monitor the state and connectivity of services managed by AWS Cloud Map, enabling early detection of service registration failures, health check errors, or mesh communication issues.\\n\\n**Alert Thresholds:**  \\n- Trigger alerts if the rate of service registration failures or health check errors exceeds 5% of total attempts within a 5-minute window.  \\n- Alert on repeated service deregistrations or mesh connectivity timeouts exceeding predefined baselines, indicating potential service instability or network issues.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High error rates** suggest service discovery problems that can lead to service unavailability, degraded performance, or cascading failures in dependent microservices.  \\n- **Low or zero errors** indicate healthy service registration and connectivity, ensuring reliable service discovery and communication.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- Dashboard widget showing a time series graph of service registration success vs failure counts from **/aws/servicediscovery/** logs.  \\n- Alert rule:  \\n  ```\\n  IF (service_registration_failures / total_registrations) > 0.05 FOR 5 minutes THEN trigger alert \\\"Service Discovery Registration Failure Rate High\\\"\\n  ```  \\nThis enables proactive identification and resolution of service discovery issues to maintain microservices reliability.\", \" - This pattern matches log entries from AWS Application Load Balancer groups that record HTTP 5XX status codes. It specifically captures server error responses indicating issues such as internal server errors (500), service unavailability (503), and gateway timeouts (504).

This log filter identifies ERROR-level messages indicating problems during deployment processes. An alert should be triggered when the count of ERROR messages exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5 errors within 5 minutes), signaling potential deployment instability or failures requiring immediate investigation. High error counts often indicate failed deployments or rollback loops impacting application availability, while low or zero errors suggest stable deployment operations. For example, use this filter in a CloudWatch alarm or dashboard widget to monitor error frequency, triggering notifications to the SRE team when error rates spike, enabling rapid response to deployment issues.\", \" - Lambda function timeout events captured in CloudWatch Logs under **LogGroup: /aws/lambda/** with messages starting with \\\"TIMEOUT\\\" indicate that a function's execution exceeded its configured maximum runtime. Alerts should trigger when timeout occurrences exceed a defined threshold, such as more than 5 timeouts within 5 minutes, signaling potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints. High timeout rates can lead to failed requests, degraded user experience, and SLA violations, while low or zero timeouts indicate healthy function execution within expected limits. For example, an alert rule can be set to trigger if the count of \\\"TIMEOUT*\\\" messages in **/aws/lambda/** exceeds 5 in a 5-minute window, and a dashboard widget can display a time series graph of timeout counts to monitor trends and quickly identify spikes requiring investigation.\", \" - Monitors AWS Lambda functions for out-of-memory (OOM) errors by detecting log entries in **/aws/lambda/** log groups containing messages starting with \\\"OUT_OF_MEMORY\\\". An alert is triggered when any OOM event occurs, indicating the function exceeded its configured memory limit during execution. High frequency of OOM errors signals insufficient memory allocation, causing function failures and degraded application stability; low or zero occurrences indicate adequate memory provisioning. Example alert rule: trigger an alert if **OUT_OF_MEMORY** messages appear more than 0 times within 5 minutes. In dashboards, visualize OOM event counts per function over time to identify memory pressure trends and prioritize memory tuning or code optimization.\", \" - This pattern matches log entries from all AWS SNS log groups where the message begins with \\\"PUBLISH\\\".

An alert should be triggered when the count of \\\"ERROR\\\" messages exceeds a defined threshold\\u2014commonly 5 errors within a 5-minute window\\u2014indicating a potential service degradation or outage. High error counts often correlate with increased latency, failed cache requests, or complete cache unavailability, impacting application responsiveness and stability. Conversely, consistently low or zero errors suggest healthy cache operation. For example, in a CloudWatch dashboard or alert rule, you might configure a metric filter using this pattern to count error occurrences and set an alarm that notifies the SRE team when the threshold is breached, enabling prompt investigation and remediation.\"]}": {

An alert should be triggered when the count of ERROR messages exceeds a threshold (e.g., 5 errors within 5 minutes), signaling potential deployment instability or failures requiring immediate investigation. High error counts often indicate failed deployments or rollback loops impacting application availability, while low or zero errors suggest stable deployment operations. For example, use this filter in a CloudWatch alarm or dashboard widget to monitor error frequency, triggering notifications to the SRE team when error rates spike, enabling rapid response to deployment issues.\", \" - Lambda function timeout events captured in CloudWatch Logs under **LogGroup: /aws/lambda/** with messages starting with \\\"TIMEOUT\\\" indicate that a function's execution exceeded its configured maximum runtime. Alerts should trigger when timeout occurrences exceed a defined threshold, such as more than 5 timeouts within 5 minutes, signaling potential performance bottlenecks or resource constraints. High timeout rates can lead to failed requests, degraded user experience, and SLA violations, while low or zero timeouts indicate healthy function execution within expected limits. For example, an alert rule can be set to trigger if the count of \\\"TIMEOUT*\\\" messages in **/aws/lambda/** exceeds 5 in a 5-minute window, and a dashboard widget can display a time series graph of timeout counts to monitor trends and quickly identify spikes requiring investigation.\", \" - Monitors AWS Lambda functions for out-of-memory (OOM) errors by detecting log entries in **/aws/lambda/** log groups containing messages starting with \\\"OUT_OF_MEMORY\\\". An alert is triggered when any OOM event occurs, indicating the function exceeded its configured memory limit during execution. High frequency of OOM errors signals insufficient memory allocation, causing function failures and degraded application stability; low or zero occurrences indicate adequate memory provisioning. Example alert rule: trigger an alert if **OUT_OF_MEMORY** messages appear more than 0 times within 5 minutes. In dashboards, visualize OOM event counts per function over time to identify memory pressure trends and prioritize memory tuning or code optimization.\", \" - This pattern monitors CloudWatch Logs from all SQS queues (LogGroup: \\\"/aws/sqs/*\\\") filtering messages starting with \\\"QUEUE\\\", which typically indicate key queue lifecycle events such as creation, deletion, configuration changes, and health status updates. It helps SREs track operational changes and potential issues affecting queue availability and performance.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold:**  \\nTrigger an alert if the number of error or warning-level \\\"QUEUE*\\\" messages exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., >5 errors within 5 minutes), indicating possible queue misconfigurations, failures, or degraded health.\\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- **High count:** May signal frequent queue disruptions, configuration errors, or health degradation, potentially impacting message processing reliability and downstream services. Immediate investigation is required.  \\n- **Low or zero count:** Indicates stable queue operations with no recent critical events.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\n- **Dashboard:** Display a time series widget showing the count of \\\"QUEUE*\\\" messages per queue over time to visualize trends in queue events.  \\n- **Alert Rule:** Create a CloudWatch metric filter on \\\"/aws/sqs/*\\\" logs for \\\"QUEUE*\\\" messages with severity ERROR or WARNING, then set an alarm to notify the SRE team if the count exceeds 5 within 5 minutes, enabling proactive response to queue issues.\", \" - This pattern monitors ElastiCache log groups in CloudWatch Logs for entries where the message begins with \\\"ERROR,\\\" capturing critical issues such as Redis or Memcached errors, connection failures, memory exhaustion, and cache engine malfunctions. It serves as an early warning system to detect operational problems affecting cache availability and performance. An alert should be triggered when the count of \\\"ERROR\\\" messages exceeds a defined threshold\\u2014commonly 5 errors within a 5-minute window\\u2014indicating a potential service degradation or outage. High error counts often correlate with increased latency, failed cache requests, or complete cache unavailability, impacting application responsiveness and stability. Conversely, consistently low or zero errors suggest healthy cache operation. For example, in a CloudWatch dashboard or alert rule, you might configure a metric filter using this pattern to count error occurrences and set an alarm that notifies the SRE team when the threshold is breached, enabling prompt investigation and remediation.\"]}": {

High error counts often indicate failed deployments or rollback loops impacting application availability, while low or zero errors suggest stable deployment operations.

High timeout rates can lead to failed requests, degraded user experience, and SLA violations, while low or zero timeouts indicate healthy function execution within expected limits.

High latency values can lead to poor user experience and indicate underlying issues such as resource bottlenecks or network delays, while consistently low latency reflects healthy system responsiveness. For example, a CloudWatch dashboard widget can graph **{\\\"message\\\": \\\"LATENCY*\\\"}** metrics with a red alert line at 500ms, and an alert rule can notify the SRE team if the 95th percentile latency exceeds this threshold for more than 5 minutes.\", \" - This pattern monitors ElastiCache log groups in CloudWatch Logs for entries where the message begins with \\\"ERROR,\\\" capturing critical issues such as Redis or Memcached errors, connection failures, memory exhaustion, and cache engine malfunctions.

It tracks key events such as metric data ingestion, processing latency, and aggregation status, enabling monitoring of the health and performance of CloudWatch metric pipelines.  \\n\\n**Purpose:** Helps SREs detect delays, failures, or anomalies in metric collection and processing that could impact monitoring accuracy and alerting reliability.\\n\\n**Alert Thresholds:**  \\n- Trigger an alert if metric processing latency exceeds 5 seconds consistently over 5 minutes, indicating potential ingestion delays.  \\n- Alert on repeated metric aggregation failures or error counts above a defined baseline (e.g., >3 errors in 5 minutes).  \\n\\n**Impact of Values:**  \\n- High latency or error counts may cause delayed or missing metrics, leading to blind spots in system observability and delayed incident response.  \\n- Low or zero error counts with stable latency indicate healthy metric pipeline operation.  \\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard, visualize the average processing latency and error count from logs matching this pattern to monitor metric pipeline health.  \\nAlert rule example (CloudWatch Logs Insights):  \\n```\\nfields @timestamp, @message\\n| filter @message like /^METRIC/\\n| stats avg(processingLatency) as avgLatency, count_if(error = true) as errorCount by bin(5m)\\n| filter avgLatency > 5000 or errorCount > 3\\n```\\nThis triggers alerts when metric processing is slow or error-prone, enabling proactive investigation and remediation.\", \" - This pattern monitors SQS visibility timeout events by capturing logs where messages become visible again after their visibility timeout expires without successful processing. It helps SREs detect when messages are not processed within the expected timeframe, potentially indicating processing delays or failures.\\n\\n**Purpose:**  \\nTo track occurrences of messages reappearing in the queue due to visibility timeouts, signaling that consumers failed to process them in time.\\n\\n**Alert Threshold:**  \\nTrigger an alert if the count of visibility timeout events exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., more than 5 occurrences within 5 minutes), indicating potential processing bottlenecks or consumer failures.\\n\\n**Impact:**  \\n- **High values:** Suggest that messages are frequently timing out and re-entering the queue, which can lead to increased processing latency, duplicate processing, and potential message loss if retries fail.  \\n- **Low or zero values:** Indicate that messages are being processed within their visibility timeout, reflecting healthy consumer performance.\\n\\n**Example Usage:**  \\nIn a CloudWatch dashboard or alert rule, use this pattern to create a metric filter counting visibility timeout logs in the last 5 minutes. Set an alarm to notify the SRE team if the count exceeds 5, enabling rapid investigation and remediation of processing delays.\"]}": {
