This includes errors such as internal server errors, service unavailable errors, and gateway timeouts. The metric indicates the proportion of requests that failed due to issues on the server-side, which can be indicative of problems with application logic, configuration, or resource constraints. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include identifying trends in error rates over time, correlating errors with specific user actions or request patterns, and triggering alerts when error rates exceed a certain threshold. This metric is particularly useful for detecting issues that may not be immediately apparent through other metrics, such as request latency or throughput.\", \" - The IntegrationLatency metric measures the time elapsed between when API Gateway forwards a request to the backend and when it receives a response from the backend for a specific stage. This metric is crucial in understanding the performance of API integrations with AWS services or custom applications. High latency values may indicate issues such as slow backend responses, network congestion, or misconfigured integration settings. Potential implications include: (1) Identifying bottlenecks in API workflows and optimizing backend response times to improve overall system responsiveness. (2) Triggering alerts when latency exceeds a certain threshold, enabling prompt investigation into potential service disruptions. (3) Correlating IntegrationLatency with other metrics, such as request count or error rates, to gain a comprehensive view of API performance.\", \" - This metric measures the latency of API Gateway for a specific stage, representing the time elapsed between when the gateway receives a request from a client and when it sends the last byte of the response back to the client. It provides insight into the performance and responsiveness of the API, allowing operators to identify potential bottlenecks or issues that may impact user experience. The metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect anomalies, such as sudden increases in latency, which could indicate a problem with the underlying infrastructure, application code, or network connectivity. Additionally, this metric can help inform capacity planning decisions by providing visibility into the current load and performance of the API Gateway.\"]}": {

It provides visibility into potential security vulnerabilities, misconfigured SSL/TLS settings, or issues with certificate trust chains. Monitoring this metric can help identify and troubleshoot problems related to TLS negotiation failures, ensuring that clients can establish secure connections to the ELB. Potential implications for operations include: (1) Identifying and addressing certificate expiration or revocation issues; (2) Troubleshooting protocol version mismatches between clients and the ELB; (3) Optimizing SSL/TLS handshake performance by adjusting settings such as session reuse or cipher suite selection.\", \" - The DaysToExpiry metric measures the number of days remaining until a certificate expires. This metric is crucial for tracking and managing certificate lifecycles within an AWS environment. It helps identify certificates that are nearing expiration, allowing teams to plan and execute timely renewals or replacements. Potential implications include: (1) alerting on low DaysToExpiry values to prompt certificate renewal or replacement; (2) using this metric as a threshold for automated certificate rotation processes; (3) integrating with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to automate certificate issuance and deployment.

Potential implications for monitoring or alerting include: setting thresholds for high latency (e.g., > 10ms) to trigger alerts when storage performance is degraded; correlating this metric with other metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage to identify root causes of performance issues; and using it as a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to track the overall health and efficiency of EBS volumes over time. However, without further context or additional information about the specific use case or environment, it is unclear how this metric should be used in practice.\", \" - The VolumeIdleTime metric measures the total time in seconds that an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume has been idle during a specified period. A volume is considered idle when there are no read or write operations on it. This metric can be used to identify volumes that have not been accessed for an extended period, which may indicate underutilization or potential issues with the underlying storage infrastructure. It can also help in capacity planning and right-sizing EBS volumes by providing insights into usage patterns. Additionally, this metric can be used as a trigger for alerting when a volume remains idle for an unusually long time, indicating a possible issue that requires investigation.\", \" - The VolumeQueueLength metric measures the number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time for an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. This metric indicates the queue length, which is the number of I/O operations that are pending completion. A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance. However, without further context or information about the specific use case or environment, it is unclear how this metric might be used in operations.\"]}": {

A failed I/O check can be an indication of underlying storage issues, such as disk errors, high latency, or insufficient resources.

This metric is a binary indicator, reporting either 0 (indicating that the volume passed the I/O check) or 1 (indicating that the volume failed the I/O check). A failed I/O check can be an indication of underlying storage issues, such as disk errors, high latency, or insufficient resources. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential storage performance problems, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime. It is essential to consider this metric in conjunction with other relevant metrics, such as 'VolumeQueueLength' and 'VolumeReadOps', to gain a comprehensive understanding of EBS volume performance.\", \" - The VolumeQueueLength metric measures the number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time for an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. This metric indicates the queue length, which is the number of I/O operations that are pending completion. A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance.

A high VolumeThroughputPercentage value suggests that the volume is effectively handling incoming I/O requests within its allocated limits, whereas a low value may indicate underutilization or potential issues with I/O throughput.

A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance.

A high VolumeThroughputPercentage value suggests that the volume is effectively handling incoming I/O requests within its allocated limits, whereas a low value may indicate underutilization or potential issues with I/O throughput.

In monitoring or alerting, this metric can trigger notifications when average or maximum duration thresholds are exceeded, helping operations teams to proactively address performance degradation and maintain optimal application responsiveness.\", \" - The ProvisionedConcurrencySpilloverInvocations metric measures the number of times a function's code is executed on standard concurrency when all provisioned concurrency is in use. This indicates that the function has exceeded its allocated concurrent execution capacity and is relying on standard concurrency to handle additional invocations. High values for this metric may indicate inefficient resource utilization, potential performance bottlenecks, or even errors in provisioning concurrency limits. It can be used to monitor and alert on situations where functions are consistently spilling over into standard concurrency, allowing teams to adjust their concurrency settings, optimize function code, or scale up resources as needed.\", \" - The VolumeQueueLength metric measures the number of read and write operation requests waiting to be completed in a specified period of time for an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. This metric indicates the queue length, which is the number of I/O operations that are pending completion. A high queue length can indicate that the volume is experiencing performance issues due to insufficient I/O capacity or network congestion. Potential implications for monitoring and alerting include: triggering alerts when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential performance degradation; using this metric in conjunction with other metrics such as VolumeReadIOPS or VolumeWriteIOPS to identify bottlenecks in the system; and incorporating it into dashboards to provide real-time visibility into volume performance. However, without further context or information about the specific use case or environment, it is unclear how this metric might be used in operations.\"]}": {

This can occur when the actual read and write capacity utilization exceeds the allocated capacity units, causing DynamoDB to throttle incoming requests. High values for this metric may indicate over-provisioning, under-provisioning, or unexpected usage patterns in the application. Potential implications include increased latency, reduced throughput, or even service unavailability if left unchecked. This metric can be used in monitoring and alerting to detect potential issues with DynamoDB resource utilization, allowing for proactive capacity planning and optimization.\", \" - The UnhealthyRoutingRequestCount metric measures the number of incoming requests that were routed to targets within an AWS service (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases) that are currently failing health checks. This metric indicates the volume of traffic being sent to unhealthy resources, which can have significant implications for application performance and user experience. High values may indicate issues with target resource availability, scaling, or configuration problems. Potential uses for this metric include identifying bottlenecks in request routing, detecting resource exhaustion, and triggering alerts for proactive maintenance or remediation efforts.\"]}": {

The surplus credits are typically accumulated during periods of low CPU utilization and can be used to handle short-term spikes in demand without incurring additional costs. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances that are consistently using more CPU credits than expected, potentially indicating inefficient resource allocation or unexpected workload patterns. It may also be useful for capacity planning and rightsizing EC2 instance types to optimize cost-effectiveness.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditsCharged metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that are charged to an AWS instance when they exceed the maximum number of earned credits allowed. This occurs when an instance consumes more CPU resources than its allocated capacity, resulting in a deficit of earned credits. The charged surplus credits are then deducted from the instance's account. This metric can be used to monitor and alert on instances that consistently or intermittently consume excessive CPU resources, leading to unnecessary charges. It may also indicate potential issues with instance sizing, workload optimization, or resource utilization. Monitoring this metric can help prevent unexpected costs and ensure optimal resource allocation.\"]}": {

This metric is a percentage value, indicating how close the instance is to reaching its EBS IOPS limit. A higher value indicates that the instance is approaching or has exceeded its allocated IOPS capacity, which can lead to performance degradation and potential throttling by AWS. Monitoring this metric allows operations teams to identify instances at risk of I/O bottlenecks and take proactive measures to scale up storage resources, adjust application workloads, or optimize database configurations to maintain optimal system performance.\", \" - The BurstBalance metric measures the percentage of I/O credits remaining in the burst bucket for an AWS instance. This metric is relevant to monitoring and optimizing storage performance, particularly in scenarios where high I/O rates are expected or have occurred. A low value indicates that the instance has consumed a significant portion of its allocated I/O credits, potentially leading to throttling or reduced performance. In operations, this metric can be used to detect potential issues with storage capacity planning, identify instances at risk of performance degradation, and inform decisions on scaling or optimizing resource allocation.\", \" - The CPUSurplusCreditBalance metric measures the number of surplus CPU credits that have been spent by an unlimited Amazon EC2 instance when its CPUCreditBalance is zero. This metric indicates the amount of excess CPU credits used by the instance beyond what was available in its CPUCreditBalance. The surplus credits are typically accumulated during periods of low CPU utilization and can be used to handle short-term spikes in demand without incurring additional costs. Monitoring this metric can help identify instances that are consistently using more CPU credits than expected, potentially indicating inefficient resource allocation or unexpected workload patterns.
