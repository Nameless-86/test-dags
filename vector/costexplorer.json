It helps SREs monitor and manage EC2 spending in near real-time to prevent unexpected budget overruns. A typical alert threshold might be set when daily EC2 costs exceed a predefined budget limit (e.g., $100/day), signaling potential over-provisioning or inefficient usage. High values indicate increased EC2 usage or costly instance types, potentially impacting operational budgets, while low values suggest cost savings or reduced resource consumption. For example, an alert rule could trigger if **{\"Service\": \"EC2\", \"MetricName\": \"UnblendedCost\"}** exceeds $100 in a 24-hour period, and a dashboard widget might display a daily cost trend line to visualize spending patterns and identify anomalies promptly."

    "description": "This metric tracks the actual unblended costs incurred for AWS IoT Device Defender security monitoring and audit services. It helps SREs monitor spending specifically related to IoT Device Defender to ensure security costs remain within budget. An alert threshold might be set if daily or monthly costs exceed expected usage patterns—for example, a sudden increase above $100 per day or a 50% rise compared to the previous period—indicating potential overuse or misconfiguration. High values could signal increased security activity or unexpected resource consumption, while low values may indicate underutilization or inactive monitoring. For instance, an alert rule could trigger when the daily UnblendedCost for IoT Device Defender exceeds $100, and a dashboard widget might display a time series graph of this metric to track cost trends and correlate them with security events."

    "description": "This metric tracks the actual unblended costs incurred by IoT Device Management services, reflecting expenses related to fleet operations and job executions. SREs can use this to monitor and control spending on IoT device management activities. A typical alert threshold might be set when daily costs exceed a predefined budget limit (e.g., $100/day), indicating potential overuse or misconfiguration. High values suggest increased usage or inefficiencies that could impact budget adherence, while low values indicate normal or reduced activity. For example, an alert rule could trigger if the 7-day rolling average of UnblendedCost surpasses $700, prompting investigation. In dashboards, this metric helps visualize cost trends over time, enabling proactive cost management and operational adjustments."

In Cost Explorer, it helps SREs monitor and manage expenses related to IoT Events usage. A typical alert threshold might be set when daily or monthly unblended costs exceed a predefined budget limit (e.g., $100/day), signaling unexpected spikes in IoT Events activity or misconfigurations. High values indicate increased IoT Events processing, which could impact budget and require investigation, while low values suggest normal or reduced usage. For example, an alert rule could trigger if **{\"Service\": \"IOTEVENTS\", \"MetricName\": \"UnblendedCost\"}** surpasses $50 in a 24-hour period, and a dashboard widget might display a time series graph of daily unblended costs to track trends and detect anomalies early."

    "description": "This metric tracks the actual unblended costs incurred by AWS IoT Greengrass services, including local compute and messaging usage. It helps SREs monitor and manage expenses related to IoT Greengrass deployments. A sudden increase beyond a predefined threshold—such as a 20% rise compared to the previous billing period or exceeding a fixed budget limit (e.g., $500/month)—should trigger an alert to investigate potential overuse or misconfiguration. High values may indicate increased device activity or inefficient resource usage, leading to higher operational costs, while low values suggest normal or reduced usage. For example, incorporate **{\"Service\": \"IOTGREENGUARD\", \"MetricName\": \"UnblendedCost\"}** into a cost monitoring dashboard with a threshold alert rule:  \n`IF UnblendedCost > $500/month OR increase > 20% month-over-month THEN trigger alert`  \nThis enables proactive cost control and timely response to unexpected billing changes."

A typical alert threshold might be set when daily costs exceed a predefined budget limit (e.g., $50/day), signaling potential overuse or misconfiguration. High values suggest increased consumption of IoT SiteWise resources, possibly due to scaling or data ingestion anomalies, while low values indicate normal or reduced usage. For example, you can create a dashboard widget displaying daily unblended costs with a red alert triggered if costs surpass $50, enabling proactive cost management and operational oversight."
